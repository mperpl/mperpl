### Hi, I'm Michał 👋

I am a Computer Science student focused on **backend development**. Starting next semester, I will also begin a specialization in cloud systems at my university.
I am actively developing my skills within the modern Python ecosystem. I am looking for my first job or internship as a Junior Backend Developer or Python Developer.
