# Hi, I'm Michał 👋

I am a **Computer Science student** and aspiring **Backend Developer** with a strong focus on building scalable and secure APIs. Currently, I am about to specialize in **Cloud Systems** to better understand modern infrastructure and deployment.

I enjoy solving problems behind the scenes and turning complex logic into clean, efficient code.
